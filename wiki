# Goal
we are not here to talk about grep, we are here to give tips on how to do general string search(ack-grep is for code)
happycasts---Linux tips for pragmatic programmers

# tips

   grep -c "Error" log.txt

show line number

   grep -n

search recursively 

  grep -R hello *

  find . -mmin -10 # '0' means less than 

    peter:~/edocs$ find . -mmin 2
    peter:~/edocs$ find . -mmin 3
    peter:~/edocs$ find . -mmin 4
    peter:~/edocs$ find . -mmin 5
    .
    ./hello

## ruby
 -i extension   Specifies in-place-edit mode.  The extension, if specified, is added to old file name to make a backup copy.  For example:

                          % echo matz > /tmp/junk
                          % cat /tmp/junk
                          matz
                          % ruby -p -i.bak -e '$_.upcase!' /tmp/junk
                          % cat /tmp/junk
                          MATZ
                          % cat /tmp/junk.bak
                          matz
